## Projects

* GHub-Meta
    * New
    * "Administrative Core Project"
    * Original "home" of this outline
    * Original Premise: Central organization hub for component projects
* GHub
    * Old
    * Hosted originally at SourceForge.net
    * Original Premise: "Extending enterprise portal systems for community assistance"
        * Contrast to
            * Complexity of enterprise portal frameworks
            * "Summer 2013"
                * No opportunity for actively pursuing community support of the project
                * No opportunity for further development of project goals
            * Community unfamiliarity with regards to trends and practices in social entrepreneurialism
    * Later Premise: Central organization hub for component projects
* Gazebo Hub Context Model (ghub-cm)
    * Premise: Context model and project model for the Gazebo Hub Project.
        * Formats
            * iThoughts
            * OWL
                * OWL RDF
        * Goals
            * Interchangeability between mindmaps and OWL context model ontologies
                * Portable ontology editing in Mindmap platforms
            * Definition of goals, scope, and application of the Gazebo Hub project, within the framework of the Gazebo Hub Context Model
            * Reusability of the context model structure and model transformation algorithms, for other projects
        * Precautions
            * Legibility of relations in some OWL context model ontologies approaches zero
                * In regards concept modeling, when a modeling tool serves to limit the conceptual depth and accuracy of the possible concept model - as would be limited to the features supported with that modeling tool - that concern may be, at least, denoted towards development of a workaround - perhaps, as to make a more modular view of the concept model.
